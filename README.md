# Fun-Physics
It is a short fun program made on the topic of physics. It starts off with cool Graphics and then gives the users an option to choose between taking a short physics quiz (time to brush up those physics skills..don't worry this program gives a quick review before testing you with the quiz)or just go through some physics topics. However, the option still continues by giving the user an opportunity by going and looking other cool graphical pages if they are not a "Physics person".
